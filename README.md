# GlobalFunction

This is a solidity program showing functions in the global name space, message context.

## Description

The program is a smart contract showing how the global functions in the message context are used.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g.,GlobalFunction.sol). Copy the code in the file "GlobalFunction.sol" found in the contracts directory into your newly created file "GlobalFunction.sol" on Remix IDE

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile GlobalFunction.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the GlobalFunction" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint or the burn function. Click on the "GlobalFunction" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint" or "burn" functions. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and you would get a success reponse.
